The requirements achieved:
1. The semantic tags used: header, nav and footer.
2. CSS positioning applied.
3. CSS Flexbox used in Header and Nav.
4. Background images applied.

The stretch requirements achieved:
1. Smooth scrolling for internal links implemented. 
2. "Back to top" button created. 
3. Hover effect on buttons implemented. 

I need to improve on 'positioning' as noticed that .container has a slightly different position depending on the browser I use. Please could you check if I've used the positioning corretly.
